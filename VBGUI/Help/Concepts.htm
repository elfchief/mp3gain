<b>Peak Normalization</b>

<p>

Most 
programs that "normalize" sound files do so by adjusting all the samples so that 
the loudest single sample is at some specified value. This is not a good way to 
make all the files actually have the same loudness. First of all, the 
human ear does not hear the loudness of single samples. It averages out 
sounds over time. Secondly, today's 
popular music CDs are heavily compressed. The sound 
engineers making the CD raise the average level so that it sounds much louder, 
while compressing the loudest parts so that they don't distort. A typical 
 uncompressed sound file might look like this:

<p>

<center><IMG height=107 src="Wave1.jpg" width=248></center>

<p>

A typical compressed sound file might look like this:

<p>

<center><IMG height=107 src="Wave2.jpg" width=248></center>

<p>

Both of these files have 
 a peak sample at about 100%, but the compressed file has a much louder 
 <i>average</i> level. 
It sounds much 
louder when played back. So 
 to do actual loudness normalization instead of peak normalization, we 
 need to calculate how loud the file actually sounds. MP3Gain uses the 
 <a href="http://replaygain.hydrogenaudio.org">Replay Gain</a> algorithm to calculate 
 this loudness.

<b><a name=Lossless></a>Lossless Gain Adjustment</b>

<p>

The bad news: MP3Gain 
 can only adjust the volume of your mp3 files in steps of 1.5 dB.

<p>

The good news: 1.5 dB 
 is a small enough step for most practical purposes. Most humans can just 
 barely hear a volume change of 1 dB.

<p>

The other good news is 
 that this volume adjustment is completely lossless. In other words, if 
 you adjust an mp3 by -6 dB and then change your mind, you can adjust it 
 again by +6 dB and it will be <i>exactly</i> the same as it was before you made 
 the first adjustment.

<p>

Here's the technical reason 
 why it's lossless, and also why the smallest change possible is 1.5 dB:

<p>

The mp3 format stores 
 the sound information in small chunks called "frames". Each frame represents 
 a fraction of a second of sound. In each frame there is a "global gain" 
 field. This field is an 8-bit integer (so its value can be a whole number 
 from 0 to 255).</p>

<p>

When an mp3 player decodes 
 the sound in the frame, it uses the global gain field to multiply the 
 decoded sound samples by 2<sup>(gain / 4)</sup>.

<p>

So if you add 1 to this 
 gain field in all the frames in the mp3, you effectively multiply the 
 amplitude of the whole file by 2<sup>(1/4)</sup> = 119% = +1.5 dB.

<p>

Likewise, if you subtract 
 1 from the global gain, you multiply the amplitude by 2<sup>(-1/4)</sup> = 84% 
 = -1.5 dB.</p>
