<h3>File List</h3>

<hr>
The File List shows you 
 all files that have been added for processing. If a file name
 is colored <span style="color: #ff0000;">RED</span>, then one or more
 of the following conditions is true:
<ul>
	
	<li>The file is currently clipping <i>(indicated by a "Y" in the "clipping" column)</i>.</li>
	
	<li>The file will have clipping if you apply <b>Track Gain</b> <i>(indicated by a "Y" in the "clip(Track)" column)</i></li>
	
	<li>The file will have clipping if you apply <b>Album Gain</b> <i>(indicated by a "Y" in the "clip(Album)" column)</i></li>
</ul>

<p>

Here is what each of the columns in the file list means:
<table>
<col style="width: 20.3%; font-weight: bold">
<col style="width: 79.7%;">

<tr>
<td>Volume</td>
<td>The current volume of 
 the mp3, in dB SPL. If you play back the mp3 in a calibrated system, it 
 will have this average sound pressure level in decibels.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>clipping</td>
<td>This column has a <b>Y</b> if the mp3 file is currently clipping. 
 <b>“Clipping”</b> means that when the mp3 file is decoded by your player, some 
 of the sound samples will be too loud. The player will “clip” these samples 
 so that they do not exceed the maximum allowable value. This clipping 
 creates a sort of rough, “scratchy” sound during loud parts of the song.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Track Gain</td>
<td>The dB change that should 
 be applied to this mp3 so that its average volume is as close to the target 
 volume as possible.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>clip (Track)</td>
<td>
This column has a <b>Y</b> if the mp3 will clip if the suggested 
 <b>Track Gain</b> is applied.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Max Noclip Gain</td>
<td><i>(Only visible when <a href="Options_menu.htm#Maximizing">Maximizing</a> features are enabled)</i><br>
Shows the maximum gain change that can be applied to this file without any clipping</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Album Volume</td>
<td>The current overall volume of the <b>Album</b>.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>Album Gain</td>
<td>The dB change that should 
 be applied to all the mp3s in the <b>Album</b> 
 so that the overall volume is as close to the target volume as possible.</td></tr>

<tr>
<td>clip (Album)</td>
<td>This column has a <b>Y</b> if the mp3 will clip if the suggested 
 <b>Album Gain</b> is applied.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>

<i>NOTE:</i> - The 
 <b>Track Gain</b> and <b>Album 
 Gain</b> columns are rounded to the nearest 
 1.5 dB change. The <a href="Concepts.htm#Lossless">lossless method</a> 
 MP3Gain uses to modify mp3 files is limited to 1.5 dB as the smallest 
 possible volume change.
 
<p>

If there is a <b>???</b> 
 in the <b>clipping</b> column for a file, 
 then the mp3 probably has some bad data in it. This 
 bad data could have been caused by a download error, a poor job of splicing 
 two mp3s into one, or other factors. Listen closely to the mp3, and somewhere 
 you'll probably be able to hear a loud click, pop, “chk”, or other sound. Because 
 of this bad data, the program cannot accurately determine the maximum 
 amplitude, because the bad data is causing extreme clipping.<br>

Fortunately, in most cases 
 the amount of bad data is small enough that it does not affect the calculation 
 of the overall volume of the file. The suggested <b>Track</b> 
 and <b>Album</b> gains are probably still valid.
