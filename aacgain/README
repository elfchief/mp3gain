AACGAIN VERSION 1.3

aacgain is a modification to Glen Sawyer's mp3gain, to support AAC 
(mp4/m4a/QuickTime) files as well as mp3 files. If you are not familiar with
mp3gain, stop reading this, and go to http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net

aacgain is released in source code form only
a) to avoid any MPEG royalty issues,
b) to ensure that early users have the knowledge to fix whatever
   bugs they find :-)
   
WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.3
a) Directory structure reorganized to be compatible with mp3gain CVS
   on sourceforge

WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.2
a) Fixes compatibility issue with MP3GainGUI version 1.2.5 or 1.3.4.
b) All temporary files created are erased.
   
WHAT'S NEW IN VERSION 1.1
a) Multi-channel and mono files now work.
b) Fixes compatibility issues with MP3GainGUI:
   - /o option always outputs Album gain
c) /f option is ignored for AAC files - see usage notes below.
d) Uses portable versions of all library functions, and has been
   successfully compiled under Linux. Thanks to Prakash Punnoor
   for his help with this.
   
BUILD INSTRUCTIONS

I created aacgain using MSVC++.NET 2003, and created the MSVC++6.0 workspace
and project files using prjconverter. Thanks to Prakash Punoor, the source code
is portable, and has been compiled under Linux. If anyone wants to contribute
Makefiles and build instructions for Linux or other OS, please email them
to me.

aacgain requires, but does not include, the following  additional components.
You need to download them from the links listed below:

a) mp3gain
   version 1.45, download file mp3gain-1_4_5-src.zip from 
   http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net
   
b) faad2 
   Download the latest "FAAD2 CVS snapshot" from
   http://www.audiocoding.com/modules/mydownloads/ aacgain is based on FAAD2 
   as of Sept. 15, 2004. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THE REGULAR SOURCE FILE PACKAGE FROM
   sourceforge.net or audiocoding.com. It is older and not compatible with the 
   code in aacgain.
   
c) mpeg4ip version 1.2, download from http://www.mpeg4ip.net
   Extract the files from the archive using a tool that writes
   the text files with DOS-style line-endings (\r\n). Winzip works fine.
   If the files are written with Unix-style line-endings (\r), MSVC++ 
   will not be able to open the project files. If this happens, you 
   can use unix2dos to repair the files.
   RENAME THE ROOT DIRECTORY FROM mpeg4ip-1.2 to mpeg4ip.
   
The components must be arranged in the following directory hierarchy:
-- aacgain containing aacgain.dsw/.sln, aacgain.dsp/.vcproj and source files
-- faad2 (create this directory and extract the faad2 archive into it)
   -- include
   -- libfaad containing libfaad.dsp
      -- codebook
      -- fftw
   other directories are not used and can be pruned if desired
-- mpeg4ip (rename from mpeg4ip-1.2 to be consistent with sourceforge CVS)
   -- include
   -- lib
      -- mp4v2 containing libmp4v2_st60.dsp
         -- util
      -- gnu containing libmissing60.dsp
   other directories are not used and can be pruned if desired
-- mp3gain (create this directory and extract the mp3gain archive into it)
   -- mpglibDBL
      
APPLY THE PATCH in file aacgain\mpeg4ip12.patch to mpeg4ip. This fixes
2 issues with libmp4v2:
a) Adds support for the iTunes "grouping" metadata tag.
b) PREVENTS FILE CORRUPTION when a file is opened using MP4Modify or
   MP4File::Modify and additional metadata tags are added.

Bill May has checked these changes into mpeg4ip's CVS, so if you checkout
the latest sources from http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=18676, instead
of downloading the archive, you don't need to apply the patch. Make sure 
that file mpeg4ip/include/mpeg4ip_version.h is version 1.2.2 or later.

To apply the patch:
a) cd mpeg4ip
b) patch -p0 -i ..\aacgain\mpeg4ip12.patch
c) the file mpeg4ip12.patch has DOS-style line endings (\r\n). If you
   downloaded mpeg4ip with unix-style line endings (\n), you must run dos2unix
   on the patch file to convert it. If patch.exe fails with "Assertion failed:
   hunk, file patch.c, line 343", this means the line endings on the patch
   file and mpeg4ip source are not the same.
   
If you don't have patch.exe, you can download it from
http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net The gnuwin32 distribution of patch.exe
requires that you also install the dlls from packages LibIconv and LibIntl
which may be downloaded from the same site.

If you use MSVC++.NET, open the following MSVC++6.0 project files and convert
them to .vcproj files in the same directory:
 - faad2\libfaad\libfaad.dsp
 - mpeg4ip\lib\mp4v2\libmp4v2_st60.dsp
 - mp3g4ip\lib\gnu\libmissing60.dsp
Then, open the solution file aacgain\aacgain.sln.

If you use MSVC++6.0, open the workspace file aacgain\aacgain.dsw. 
Unfortunately prjconverter does not convert project dependencies, so
you must make project aacgain dependent on the other projects,
so that it links last. If anyone has MSVC++6.0 and can email me a correct
aacgain.dsw file, please do so.

With either compiler, there should be 5 projects in your workspace/solution:
1. aacgain
2. libfaad
3. libmissing60
4. libmp4v2_st
5. mp3gainlib
            
Make the following changes to the libfaad project properties:
a) Change the C++/Code generation/Runtime Library property for libfaad to
   "Single-threaded Debug (/MLd)" for debug build and "Single-threaded (/ML)"
   for release build. 
b) Change the Librarian/Ignore All Default Libraries property to 
   "Yes (/NODEFAULTLIB)" for both debug and release builds.

At this point, you may press F7 and cross your fingers:-)

USAGE NOTES

1. BACK UP YOUR MUSIC FILES BEFORE USING AACGAIN! THIS IS BETA SOFTWARE.
   I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGED FILES.
2. aacgain supports files in the mp4/Quicktime file format. These files
   usually have a file extension of .mp4 or .m4a. Raw AAC files, or
   files encoded with HE-AAC/SBR are not supported.
3. DRM'ed files purchased from the iTunes music store are not supported. You
   may convert these to .m4a format by burning them to a CD-ROM and importing
   them back into iTunes, or by using one of the underground methods to
   directly convert them to .m4a.
4. aacgain takes the same command line options as mp3gain - no
   changes have been made to the command usage.
5. If you rename the aacgain.exe executable to mp3gain.exe, it will work 
   with the Visual Basic front-end MP3GainGUI.exe. There are some compatibility
   issues regarding error codes. Glen Sawyer has requested I leave these codes
   as-is, and a future release of MP3GainGUI will interpret them correctly.
   If you don't get any errors you should not have any problems.
6. When calculating or applying album gain, you may mix aac and mp3 files
   in the same command.
7. The /t (use temp file) parameter is highly recommended. Without it, if
   you interrupt aacgain while it is updating the gain or metadata, your
   aac file will be left in a corrupted state. /t uses the mp4v2 Optimize 
   function which reduces the final file size. The extra processing
   time added by the /t option is barely noticable.
8. The /w (wrap) flag is ignored for aac files, since allowing an aac file
   to wrap will leave it in an unplayable state.
9. The /f (assume input file is an MPEG 2 Layer III) option is ignored
   for AAC files. If a file starts with a 'ftyp' atom, it is assumed to be
   AAC, even if /f was specified.
10. The following metadata tags will be added to your files:
     - replaygain_track_gain
     - replaygain_album_gain
     - replaygain_track_peak
     - replaygain_album_peak
     - replaygain_track_minmax
     - replaygain_album_minmax
     - replaygain_undo
    These are all free-form metadata tags (moov.udta.meta.ilst.----)
    with 'data' text fields in the same format as the mp3gain
    equivalents. You may use mp4dump (located in mpeg4ip\lib\mp4v2\util)
    to view the tags.
11. I have tested aacgain for compatibility with both iTunes and
    fubar2000, and I am not aware of any problems. Please let me know
    if you find any.

HOW IT WORKS

Files syntax.c and decoder.c are slightly modified versions of the
corresponding files from faad2. The modifications allow the positions
and original values of the global_gain fields to be saved. faad2 is
also used to decode the compressed audio into linear PCM for analysis
by the replaygain algorithm.

mpeg4ip/lib/mp4v2 is used to parse the mp4/QuickTime file format, to
read individual samples so that they can be passed to faad2, and to
read and write metadata tags. File MP4MetaFile.cpp subclasses mp4v2
class MP4File. Additional functionality was added to modify the global_gain
fields within a sample.

aacgain.cpp is a wrapper for the above functionality.

mp3gain.c is a minor modification of the original version, which calls
the above wrapper functions so that AAC files may be used.

The mp3gainlib project builds and links all of the original mp3gain files,
with the exception of mp3gain.c and replaygaindll.c, into a static library
that is used by aacgain's version of mp3gain.c.
   
ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

I am a total newbie to digital audio, and I created aacgain primarily
as a learning exercise. I couldn't have done it without the help of others:

1. Thanks to the user community at hydrogenaudio.org and audiocoding.com,
   especially Menno and Hans-Jürgen.
2. Thanks to Bill May for helping me get started with mpeg4ip.
3. Last, but not least, thanks to Glen Sawyer for creating mp3gain.
